    <p> <i> BRIDGES works with both C++ and Java. Setting up BRIDGES is slightly
      different , so we provide help pages on building a simple BRIDGES program.
      Currently detailed help pages for using BRIDGES with Eclipse is provided.
      See the links below. However, there are many ways to run a BRIDGES program.
      These distinctions are detailed below:</i> <p>
        <div>
          <h4> BRIDGES(Java Version)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> A Jar file is provided(see the links on the left) that contains all the needed
              classes to run a BRIDGES program(including on command line, so long as the JAR
              is part of your Java class path.

                    </div>
                    <div>
                      <h4> BRIDGES(C++ Version)</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li> The C++ version is provided with a set of templated classes, all housed in
                          header files. Thus, so long as these header files can be accessed by the BRIDGES
                          application, that is all that is needed. See the links left for C++ BRIDGES
                          Zip archive.
                          <li> The C++ version works with the <a href = "https://curl.haxx.se">CURL</a> library,
                            for communicating with the web server and transmitting assignments for
                            visualization.
                            <li> For expert users, or users who prefer command line or makefiles, BRIDGES
                              programs can be compiled and linked with the curl library and executed, so long
                              as the include(both the Bridges and Curl headers) and library options
                              (Curl library) are specified based on their local installation.
